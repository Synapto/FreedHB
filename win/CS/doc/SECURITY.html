<h1>Security Policy</h1>

<h2>Reporting a Vulnerability</h2>

<p>If you believe youâ€™ve found a security vulnerability in HandBrake or our website (https://handbrake.fr) please send details to us by emailing</p>

<p>security /at/ handbrake /dot/ fr</p>

<p>Contributors to this project are also available in <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=handbrake">#handbrake on Freenode IRC</a> (irc://irc.freenode.net/#handbrake).
Please note, #handbrake and #handbrake-dev are public so details should only be send to contributors via private message.</p>

<h2>Responsible Disclosure</h2>

<p>We kindly ask that you use responsible disclosure practices when alerting us to any security related issues.
This allows us time to investigate and take corrective action where necessary.</p>

<p>Our goal is to deal with any issues reported as quickly as possible.  If you do not receive a direct response from us within 24 hours, please follow up with us as we may not have received the message.</p>
