<p>HandBrake License</p>

<p>Most files in HandBrake are under the GNU General Public License Version 2
(GPLv2) license; read the file COPYING for details.</p>

<p>Some files are under the GNU General Public License Version 2 or any later
version (GPLv2+), the GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1 or any later
version (LGPLv2.1+), or BSD/MIT/X11-style licenses. In combination, the GPLv2
license applies to HandBrake.</p>

<p>The Fraunhofer AAC library (fdk-aac) is under a license incompatible with the
GPLv2 license. Since both licenses cannot be satisfied simultaneously, binaries
resulting from the combination of HandBrake and fdk-aac are neither free nor
redistributable. As a result, fdk-aac is by default not included in HandBrake.
If you wish to include fdk-aac in your personal build of HandBrake, you may do
so by passing &ndash;enable-fdk-aac to configure and making sure not to distribute
any resulting binaries. Please read the fdk-aac license for details.</p>
